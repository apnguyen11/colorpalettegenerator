Color Palette Generator

Your app should:

Have a "Randomize Colors" button
Show 5 colors on the screen
Each color should have a hex code and a "LOCK/UNLOCK" button
Clicking the "Randomize Colors" buton should only randomize the colors of the unlocked sections
index.html includes Bootstrap v4 for your convenience. If you want an example of how to design your HTML, check out https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LqXPbB?editors=1000
